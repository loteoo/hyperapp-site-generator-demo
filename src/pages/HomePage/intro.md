**Hyperstatic** is a thin navigation layer on top of [hyperapp](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/hyperapp) that helps create *fast* and SEO friendly **static sites**.

It's goal is to be a simpler, lighter and faster Gatsby, that uses hyperapp instead of React, with a runtime of ~4kb total. (hyperapp + hyperstatic runtime)

It's TypeScript codebase has an inherently small footprint by using Puppeteer for pre-rendering and dynamic imports for code-splitting.

Sites built with hyperstatic are meant to be deployed on static hosting services like Netlify or Github Pages, but can be hosted on any static file server.

## About this site
This is site acts as documentation for hyperstatic but also as a demo of it's capabilities. Each page is prerendered so it should work even with JS disabled. Try it out!

Feel free to play around with network throtling to better see how the runtime reacts.
